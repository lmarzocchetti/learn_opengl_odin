# Learn OpenGL in Odin 
I'm Currently reading the book [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) which is written in C. I'm following using the Odin language so, i'm implementing every example in Odin just like the book.

### Usage
Clone the repository and simply do:
```
$ odin run <name_of_the_example_folder>
```
like:
```
$ odin run 0_0_rectangle
```
